Daily Ansible
=========

An Ansible role to configure the daily Ansible cron.

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - daily_ansible
